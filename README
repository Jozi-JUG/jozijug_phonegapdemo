mgwt and gwt-phonegap
========================

mgwt is an open source mobile widget frame work for GWT, see http://www.m-gwt.com
gwt-phonegap http://code.google.com/p/gwt-phonegap/

This has been altered by Richard Kolb for a demo to the JoziJUG
(Most of this source code is still from the original author)
Repackaged so a nice archetype can be created

To get started
========================

1) checkout source
2) run mvn package
3) run mvn gwt:run (two commands for Superdev mode to work)
